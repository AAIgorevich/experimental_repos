## Working style of competent interaction with the version control system

### Good practice, `commit messages`.

- feat or feature: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- fix            : (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- docs           : (changes to the documentation)
- style          : (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- refactor       : (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- test           : (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- chore          : (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

### Good practice, `branch name`.

- hotfix :	for quickly fixing critical issues, usually with a temporary solution
- bugfix :	for fixing a bug
- feature:	for adding, removing or modifying a feature
- test   :	for experimenting something which is not an issue
- wip    :	for a work in progress
